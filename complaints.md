# Founder & Coders Complaints documentation

## Complaints policy

We view complaints as an opportunity to learn and to put things right for the person that has made the complaint.

Our policy is: 

+ To provide a fair complaints procedure which is clear and easy to use for anyone wishing to make a complaint;
+ To publicise the existence of our complaints procedure so that people know how to contact us to make a complaint
+ To make sure everyone at FAC knows what to do if a complaint is received;
+ To make sure all complaints are investigated fairly and in a timely way;
+ To make sure that complaints are, wherever possible, resolved and that relationships are repaired;
+ To gather information which helps us to improve what we do.

### Definition of a Complaint
A complaint is any expression of dissatisfaction, whether justified or not, about any aspect of FAC.

### Where Complaints Come From

Complaints may come from our students, our alumni or any member of the public who uses our services or attends an event that we organise, whether paid or not;

All complaint information will be handled sensitively, telling only those who need to know and following any relevant data protection requirements.

### Responsibility

Overall responsibility for this policy and its implementation lies with the Directors.

### Review

This policy is reviewed regularly and updated as required.

## Complaints Procedure

Complaints can be made by email to complaints@foundersandcoders.com.

The complainant can expect to receive an acknowledgement within a week. The acknowledgement should include a link to this document, say who is dealing with the complaint, and when the complainant can expect a reply.

### Resolving complaints

In many cases, a complaint is best resolved by the person responsible for the issue being complained about.

If the complaint relates to a specific person, they should be informed and given a fair opportunity to respond.

Complaints that cannot be resolved by direct communication between the complainant and the person or people being complained about will be investigated by the Directors or by a panel appointed by the Directors.

Ideally complainants should receive a definitive reply within four weeks. If this is not possible, because, for example, an investigation has not been fully completed, a progress report should be sent with an indication of when a full reply will be given.

### Variation of the Complaints Procedure

The Directors may vary the procedure for good reason. This may be necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, for example, a complaint about a Director should not also have the Director managing the complaint.
