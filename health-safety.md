# Health and Safety Policy Statement

If a company employs more than five members of staff, it is a legal requirement to have a Health and Safety Policy Statement. Although Founders & Coders has no employees who are not also directors of the company, we do [intend to] have such a statement.

Our statement of general policy is:

+ To provide adequate control of the health and safety risks arising from our work
activities;
+ To consult with our employees on matters affecting their health and safety;
+ To provide and maintain safe plant and equipment;
+ To ensure safe handling and use of substances;
+ To provide information instruction and supervision for employees;
+ To ensure all employees are competent to do their tasks, and to give them adequate
training;
+ To prevent accidents and cases of work-related ill health
+ To maintain safe and healthy working conditions; and
+ To review and revise this policy as necessary at regular intervals.
